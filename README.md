The first upload is a class project in Statistical learning -- My first introduction to Computer Vision work. 

This analysis is an application of deep learning and an introduction to computer vision problems. Specifically, I target the utilization of these techniques to medical imaging and was inspired research previously conducted on this topic[2]. The goal of this analysis is to use X-ray scans of chest and lungs from the Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center in China, and be able to predict with the most accuracy, cases of Pneumonia. Diagnosing Pneumonia quickly and efficiently is an issue in the medical community especially during a global pandemic like Sars-Cov-19. [3]. Medical imaging is experiencing a growth of artificial intelligence (AI) driven applications which are scale-able and seek to eliminate error rates as well as perform faster than human practitioners.
